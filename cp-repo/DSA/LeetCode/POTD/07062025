1.Problem Statement: 
	You are given a string s and a robot that currently holds an empty string t. Apply one of the following operations until s and t are both empty:

	1. Remove the first character of a string s and give it to the robot. The robot will append this character to the string t.
	2. Remove the last character of a string t and give it to the robot. The robot will write this character on paper.
	Return the lexicographically smallest string that can be written on the paper.
2.Test Case: 
	TC1: "zza"
	TC2: "bac"
	TC3: "bdda"

===============
Solving

1. Understanding:
	- Have three places ones, tens, hundrendth and keep even at ones place always.
	- Find all unique values.
2. Follow up questions:
	- Length of array? Min should be 3. [boundary value testing]
	- What to return if not possible. [-ve testing]
3. Intuition:
	- Have Integer array storing frequency of digits.
	- Put nums for current index and let recursion handle other cases.
4. Approach:
	- List for easier insertion of records (nums).
