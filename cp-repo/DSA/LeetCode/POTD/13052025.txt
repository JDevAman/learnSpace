1.Problem Statement: 
	- Given a string s, and integer t representing no of transformations. Find length after performing operations.
	- In one transformation, if not 'z' -> ch becomes ch + 1, else ch becomes 'ab';
2.Test Case: 
	TC1: []
	TC2: []

===============
Solving

1. Understanding:
	- Have three places ones, tens, hundrendth and keep even at ones place always.
	- Find all unique values.
2. Follow up questions:
	- Length of array? Min should be 3. [boundary value testing]
	- What to return if not possible. [-ve testing]
3. Intuition:
	- Have Integer array storing frequency of digits.
	- Put nums for current index and let recursion handle other cases.
4. Approach:
	- List for easier insertion of records (nums).
