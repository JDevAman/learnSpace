### Object Oriented Design

* **sudoCODE Design Patterns Playlist**: [Design Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTCrU9sGybuo3HIJUKusfhB_m7QucuDTQ)

> [System Design Primer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTCrU9sGyburBw9wNOHebv9SjlE4Elv5a), not necessary for the interview, but good to know, as it will help while answering technical related LP questions.

Some Tips to prepare for the OOD questions:
* Practice, Practice and Practice, as much as you can, as the more you practice, the more you will be comfortable with the OOD questions.

### Leadership Principles

* **Amazon Leadership Principles**: [Amazon Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)
* **Exponent**: [Amazon Behavioral Interview](https://youtu.be/6p1m2nCE7jE?si=HsKS1rr8reT0iFy8)

Some Tips to prepare for the LP questions:
* I have prepared each answer for each leadership principle, and I have also prepared the STAR format for each answer.
* Do not try to answer, anything, which you are not aware of, as the interviewer will ask you to explain more about it. The interviewer will ask you many follow-up questions, so be prepared for it.
* Do not try to fake the answer, as the interviewer will catch you, and you will be rejected.
* You cannot improvise your answer on the spot, so be prepared with the answer, and practice it multiple times.
